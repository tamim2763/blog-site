### Node.js & Express Blog

A dynamic, full-stack blog application built with Node.js, Express, and EJS.

This project demonstrates core backend web development concepts. It features a complete **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API that handles blog posts, renders them using **server-side rendering** (SSR), and manages **dynamic routing** for individual posts.

Posts are stored in-memory, demonstrating data persistence within a server's lifecycle. The front-end is enhanced with client-side JavaScript (jQuery) to style posts dynamically.

### Features

* **Create:** Write and publish new blog posts.
* **Read:** View all published posts (with a "Read More" snippet) and view a full post on its own page.
* **Update:** Edit existing posts.
* **Delete:** Remove posts.

### Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Templating:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
* **Middleware:** body-parser
* **Styling:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* **Client-side JS:** jQuery (for random-colored backgrounds)
